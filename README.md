## My process

  this is my first project using a task manager like trello and my efficienty went reasonible high for 
  i separated all the task that need it to be done from the markup to the refactorization of the js

  in the markup i created all the containers that where show in the design even the ones that need it
  data to exist like the short url one, styled and then i make it dynamic with JS

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Font Awesome
- functional programing
- Javascript


### What I learned

this project was full with knew things that i didn't know about like the LocalStorage and tried new techniques like compose functions, memoize and the use of fetch and then to manage promises through functions 


```js
const compose = (f, g) => (data) => g(f(data));
}
```
